        Reflections, Rewind.<br>
        Glorious past replaced by retarded places to be.
        <br>
        Like every time, coming along, something new.<br>
        Optimistickenough, rest left for reflection.
        <br> <p>
        Replacement might not be the answer,<br>
        Resentment certainly isn't.
        <br>
        Reprogramming in the cards,<br>
        the world been sea wavering them hard.
        <br>
        Symphony for the yards,<br>
        sleepless for them wars.
        <br>
        Choice or fate, thou decide. <br>
        Thou shall fate be present upon you, none bestowed beneathe.

        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">  V-day Misery. </h1>   <br> <br>
        
        It was another morning too, <br>
        bright and promising to light up the miserable measly lives,<br>
        while all it did was bring me down to another noon of bright sparkle,of the sun. <br>
        It never felt bright enough to boil me ups, <br>
        nor was it enough to turmoil my downs.
        <br> <p>
        All it came to was another day,<br>
        anything additional would have been a surprise.<br>
        Hope is one thing, misery is another,<br>
        never been any day so treacherous enough to pull me thoughts,<br>
        any day better to pull my souls together,<br>
        but all I had was hope.
        <br><p>
        Then came the dawn, on the couch of my dreams,<br>
        looking for the love of my life.<br>
        On a rooftop only a hopeless romantic can imagine, <br>
        so full,  yet so fragile.<br>
        Heart full of life, soulful of love, with no one to give,<br>
        other than the stars who return it back to me every hour or so,<br>
        this day has never been less of a nightmare.
        <br><p>
        I used to find light in the mighty mirror,<br>
        strong as it is, to hold me still, <br>
        bold enough, to stare at me with will.<br>
        Not this day, this hits just different.<br><p>

        I have never won the fight of this.<br>
        Maybe the forgotten might come back one day,<br>
        with all the love restored upon broken hearts,<br>
        or it might end up like the wind behind her hair,<br>
        all it does is just, escape.

    <div id="poem_3"> 
        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">  Who am I? </h1>  <br> <br> 
        
        Memories define me, <br>
        And so do moments. <br>
        I'm indulged in the cult of complexity,<br>
        Form new presents for the present,<br>
        Until the crescents aren't incomplete anymore..
        <br> <p>
        The puzzle is unclear, but i have a sword, <br>
        And my heart is wide open to cuts.<br>
        Walking away gave me power,<br>
        The strength that missed,<br>
        And the weakness that was posessed.
        <br> <p>
        Although it does good for some,<br>
        It never made anything worthwhile,<br>
        Rather giving it away did.<br>
        It may lead to cuts and querries<br>
        For it can be undone by claws and berries
        <br> <p>
        Let heart be made of rock,<br>
        But glass enough for the right one.<br>
        It breaks and it builds,<br>
        Not edge of the seats,<br>
        rather reach the unreached,<br>
        And beneath the same breathe,<br>
        For it has been long enough together;<br>
        In fact, it has been built by them.
