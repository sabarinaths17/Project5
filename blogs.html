    This is all about surviving in this generation of constant change and about the crises and problems we have to face. 
    I have seen lots of millennials growing up, and also my parents who are from an entirely different planet, which is 
    why I believe I can relate to both experiences, the good and the bad of both. But hey, I’m just 22 years old, and how 
    much of the world have I seen?
    <p>
    Maybe in a world where everything is a copy-of-a-copy, I have seen enough to spread betterment to each and every one reading this. 
    Not only to relate, but to realize and to reciprocate what’s objectively good, but also taking into account the feelings into account. 
    <br>
    I have been the emotionally available one who has been fucked up one hundred times, and have I been the person who can switch off all the emotions to stand as hard as a rock. I hope I can help, 
    even if I didn’t, I’m sure you can relate to me very well. Kudos in advance!

        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">  The modern-day Relationship Crisis - a small journal! </h1>   <br> <br>
        
        Friends, relationships, family, and all the other things that may come to mind when hearing the title, 
        I am profoundly confused as to what our future will look like. Like any other Gen-Z survivor who is enjoying 
        the benefits of the current times whilst being worried about the consequences our current lifestyle would bring
         about, this will be the question of the modern times. Although many are okay with the current scenario, I am 
         nothing but perplexed bout the simplicity that is adamant in the destruction of strong relationships that have
          kept our society together for so long, yet amazed at how far we have gone in many of these aspects.
          <p>
        With the astounding rise of casual relationships all over the world, the probability of finding lifelong partners 
        for people who wish to has increasingly decreased over the years. Be it school, college, workplace, or society in 
        general, all you see are casual ones looking from above the strata. It is possible that we are actually reverting 
        to ancient times since we might all be slaves to our biology. As social media progressed, this has only gotten 
        worse. Not saying all these did not exist previously, but the current magnitude is as high as it looks, astounding!
        <p>
        To people who want all these to prevail, this might be the time of their lives. I don’t know about the long-term
         happiness factor, I still need more time to analyze that. However, for the small minority of the people who are 
         still old school, and want lifelong partners or long-standing relationships, this generation might be the final
          nail in the coffin. And unluckily, I’m one of them.
          <p>
        Not only about love relationships or life partners, about friends, about using people for one’s own needs, about 
        narcissism, about the brutal realities of the modern world. You gotta adapt in a way that is too hurtful for some
         of us. Too good for the others, but it all comes at a cost. It all has a saturation point tho, the temporary pleasures,
          the dopamine surges, and the progressive overload of people into our lives to solve different problems that prevail in 
          the current timeline, I’m confused as to where this is going. At the same time, I’m adapting to all these. Lazy evolution,
           crazy extinction, or a phase of conviction - all we have is now. And all we can do is, survive. It is indeed a problem and
            solution at once. But hey, we are one among the masses. Be selfish and thrive, maybe, I don’t know!

        As I am writing this today, I am 22 years old, living in a town area on the outskirts of God’s Own Country. 
        It hadn’t been an easy life so far, not bad either. What I can say is, that I have enjoyed it so far overall, 
        looking forward to the future, and without any barriers, I can say I am fully happy and content as of today. 
        What tomorrow awaits, tomorrow shall bring. And I shall be prepared, with the knowledge, experience, and with 
        my mind, I can power through it, be it good or what, regardless of what it brings.
        <p>

        With this page, I am not only looking forward to writing about my journey, but I am also looking forward to putting
         forward interesting & informative articles, along with excerpts from my journals that many of you can relate to. 
         You can view this as a safe space, but at the same time not forgetting that I am also a human, and I can be evil
          as well, at least at times. I believe there is no good without evil, and you have to be evil if the circumstance 
          requires you to be.
          <p>
        
        Today, I am living a life that is an average 22-year-old’s experience. At home, no jobs, thinking about the future,
         alone most of the time, in my room, and on-line online, all the time. Youtube is my go-to while Instagram is my escape.
          Having said this, I won’t say I have the worst life either. I have the best parents and the best sibling one can wish 
          for, for me at least. They aren’t perfect either. But their imperfections will never outweigh their good side. I can 
          always count on them. And as I have grown, my relationship with them has only become better, as I become a better person and learnt how to communicate better with them.
          <p>
        I had my bad periods. Everything about where I am today, I am grateful for the work I have done. It is what held me even
         when everything fell apart. Yeah, my family is always there for me. But I don’t know if it’s an introvert thing, I face 
         everything alone and inside my head. So when problems arise, their support can only do so much. What you do yourself is 
         the most crucial part of your survival. I am like that, or at least, I used to like that mostly. It is where all other
          stories come into play.
          <p>
        Let my good stories influence you, you may virtually be my soulmate at least for a few moments when you read my bad ones. 
        You be the ones that comfort me, when the ones that should have done it have cut through me!
